    "description": "“The opposite of love is not hate, it's indifference. The opposite of art is not ugliness, it's indifference. The opposite of faith is not heresy, it's indifference. And the opposite of life is not death, it's indifference.” Apathy is the acceptance of the unacceptable. Understand that when you are feeling apathetic it is because the wiring in your brain is not working properly. You literally can't care. I have been there multiple times. When you feel apathetic is precisely the time when you must crank up the volume; transformation is in process. Willpower is the key to success. Successful people strive no matter what they feel by applying their will to overcome apathy, doubt, or fear. Apathy is one of the characteristic responses of any living organism when it is subjected to stimuli too intense or too complicated to cope with. The cure for apathy is comprehension. Enthusiasm increases a person’s accomplishments while apathy increases his alibis.",

Raise your eyebrows.  Ice Cubes on your face once a day and cold water will preserve your youth. Additional Castor Oil will penetrate and  nourish your skin. Avoid Chemicals. Implement these small changes and ensure you have the face you deserve.",

  "description": "The eagle has the longest lifespan of its species and can live up to 70 years. At 40, its talons can no longer grab prey, its beak is bent, and its wings are too heavy to fly. The eagle then flies to a mountaintop, breaks off its beak, pulls out its talons and feathers, and after 150 days it is reborn and can live another 30 years",
